\section{Introduction}
Bubbles and financial crashes are important themes of financial markets. Asset bubbles describe the situation where asset prices significantly deviate from their fundamental values. Notable historical bubble includes the Dutch tulip mania in 1637, the dot-com bubble in 1990s, and the US housing bubble in 2000s. Investors who are unaware of the potential risks of bubbles paid huge prices when markets crashed.
